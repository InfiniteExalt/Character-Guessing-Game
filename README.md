# Character-Guessing-Game

Inspired by games like 20 questions and Akinator.

The program asks the player questions about a character they're thinking of. This gives the program information in order to guess the character. We created a csv with many characters and their answers to some questions. The main algorithm keeps "confidence" scores for characters and works to minimize the entropy.
